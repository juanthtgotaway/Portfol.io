## Description
The intent for this project was to display the projects I have worked on along this 6 month bootcamp that each specialize on certain topics covered in class.  
Along the way creating this portfolio page I learned various new concepts and new tools to add to my tool belt. The most important being the following: 
* The importance of downloading the correct files. In this project I used bootstrap. However, when I started I only had the normal bootstrap installed and not the react bootstrap which caused a lot of styling hiccups in the beginning causing me to focus first on the bare bones html and worry about the styles last. I discovered this issue thanks to my tutor Katie Redford. Once this was discovered, adding styles was a lot faster. Using the correct bootstrap in return helped with the proper layouts, forms, and design styles.
