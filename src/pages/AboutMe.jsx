        <p>
          Hello! My name is Juan Acevedo Martinez. I am deeply immersed in the insurance industry, 
          specializing in business insurance, with comprehensive licensing in life, health, property, 
          and casualty insurance in Colorado. My commitment to providing the best insurance solutions is 
          driven by a passion for safeguarding businesses and ensuring their resilience and growth. 
          Alongside my career in insurance, I am currently enhancing my skillset through a coding bootcamp, 
          aiming to transition into software engineering. This journey reflects my dedication to continuous 
          learning and my interest in leveraging technology to solve complex problems. Outside of my 
          professional endeavors, I am an avid car enthusiast and a creative Lego builder, pursuits that 
          showcase my appreciation for intricate design and innovation. Connect with me on LinkedIn to share 
          insights, opportunities, and to discuss the future of technology in business solutions.
